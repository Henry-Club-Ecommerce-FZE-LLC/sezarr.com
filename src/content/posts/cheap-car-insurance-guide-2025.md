## When Cheap Insurance Costs More {#avoiding-mistakes}

### Coverage Gaps That Create Expensive Problems

#### Insufficient Liability Limits
**The Risk:** Lawsuits exceeding policy limits expose personal assets
**Example:** $25,000 bodily injury limit vs. $150,000 average serious injury cost
**Solution:** Minimum 100/300/100 coverage; consider umbrella policy for high net worth

#### Skipping Uninsured Motorist Coverage
**The Risk:** No protection from uninsured drivers (13% nationally)
**Cost:** Often adds $100-200 annually
**Benefit:** Protects against $50,000+ in potential losses

#### High Deductibles Without Emergency Fund
**The Risk:** Unable to pay deductible when claims occur
**Example:** $2,000 deductible with $500 emergency fund
**Result:** Delayed repairs compromise safety and vehicle value

### Service Quality vs. Price Balance

#### Red Flags of Problem Insurers
**Warning Signs:**
- Significantly below-market pricing
- Poor financial strength ratings (B+ or lower)

- Limited customer service hours

### Smart Shopping Guidelines

#### Minimum Service Standards
**Non-Negotiable Requirements:**
- A- or better financial rating
- 24/7 claims reporting
- Mobile app functionality
- Direct payment to repair shops
- Satisfaction guarantee programs

#### Price vs. Value Optimization
**Balanced Approach:**
- Focus on total cost of ownership, not just premium
