const faqs = [
  {
    question: "What is the difference between HMO and PPO health plans?",
    answer: "HMO (Health Maintenance Organization) plans require you to choose a primary care physician and get referrals for specialists, but typically have lower costs. PPO (Preferred Provider Organization) plans offer more flexibility to see specialists directly and use out-of-network providers, but usually cost more."
  },
  {
    question: "How do health insurance deductibles work?",
    answer: "A deductible is the amount you pay out-of-pocket before your insurance begins covering costs. For example, with a $2,000 deductible, you pay the first $2,000 of covered medical expenses, then insurance kicks in. Preventive care is typically covered before meeting your deductible."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I get health insurance if I have pre-existing conditions?",
    answer: "Yes, under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), health insurance companies cannot deny coverage or charge higher premiums based on pre-existing medical conditions. This applies to all ACA-compliant plans sold through marketplaces and directly from insurers."
  },
  {
    question: "What are essential health benefits under the ACA?",
    answer: "The ACA requires all marketplace plans to cover 10 essential health benefits: ambulatory care, emergency services, hospitalization, maternity care, mental health/substance abuse treatment, prescription drugs, rehabilitative services, laboratory services, preventive care, and pediatric services."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I qualify for premium tax credits?",
    answer: "Premium tax credits are available for individuals and families with household incomes between 100% and 400% of the federal poverty level who purchase coverage through the Health Insurance Marketplace and don't have access to affordable employer coverage."
  },
  {
    question: "When can I enroll in health insurance?",
    answer: "You can enroll during Open Enrollment (November 1 - January 15 for most states) or during Special Enrollment Periods triggered by qualifying life events like marriage, birth of a child, loss of coverage, or moving to a new area."
