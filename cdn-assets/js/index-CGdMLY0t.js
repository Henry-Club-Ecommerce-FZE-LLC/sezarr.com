      question: "What does homeowners insurance typically cover?",
      answer: "Standard homeowners insurance covers dwelling (structure), other structures (detached garage, shed), personal property, liability protection, medical payments, and additional living expenses. It protects against covered perils like fire, theft, windstorm, and vandalism."
    },
    {
      question: "How much homeowners insurance coverage do I need?",
      answer: "You need enough dwelling coverage to rebuild your home at current construction costs, typically 80-100% of replacement cost. Personal property coverage should reflect the value of your belongings, and liability coverage should protect your assets and future income."
    },
    {
      question: "What's the difference between actual cash value and replacement cost?",
      answer: "Actual cash value pays the depreciated value of items, while replacement cost coverage pays to replace items with new ones of similar quality. Replacement cost coverage costs more but provides better protection for your belongings."
    },
    {
      question: "Does homeowners insurance cover flood damage?",
      answer: "No, standard homeowners insurance does not cover flood damage. You need separate flood insurance through the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) or private insurers. Flood insurance has a 30-day waiting period, so buy coverage before you need it."
    },
    {
      question: "How can I lower my homeowners insurance premiums?",
      answer: "You can reduce premiums by increasing deductibles, bundling with auto insurance, installing security systems, maintaining good credit, choosing wind-resistant materials, and comparing quotes from multiple insurers annually."
    },
    {
      question: "What factors affect homeowners insurance rates?",
      answer: "Key factors include home value, location, construction type, age of home, roof condition, claims history, credit score, deductible amount, and coverage limits. Homes in areas prone to natural disasters typically cost more to insure."
