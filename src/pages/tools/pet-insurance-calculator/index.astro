      <h2>Understanding Pet Insurance Coverage</h2>
      
      <h3>Types of Pet Insurance</h3>
      <p>Pet insurance policies typically fall into these categories:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Accident Only:</strong> Covers injuries from accidents like broken bones or poisoning</li>
        <li><strong>Accident & Illness:</strong> Covers accidents plus illnesses like cancer, infections, and hereditary conditions</li>
        <li><strong>Comprehensive:</strong> Includes accidents, illnesses, and often preventive care like vaccines</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Key Policy Terms</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Deductible:</strong> Amount you pay before insurance coverage begins (annual or per-incident)</li>
        <li><strong>Reimbursement Rate:</strong> Percentage of covered costs the insurer pays back (typically 70%, 80%, or 90%)</li>
        <li><strong>Annual/Lifetime Limits:</strong> Maximum amount the policy will pay per year or over your pet's lifetime</li>
        <li><strong>Waiting Period:</strong> Time between enrollment and when coverage becomes active</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>How This Calculator Works</h3>
      <p>Our calculator estimates costs based on:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Pet species, breed, and age (older pets and certain breeds cost more)</li>
        <li>Your location (veterinary costs vary by region)</li>
        <li>Coverage level and policy options you select</li>
        <li>Current market rates from major pet insurance providers</li>
      </ul>

        <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-3">ðŸ’¡ Pet Insurance Tips</h4>
        <ul class="space-y-2">
          <li>Enroll pets while they're young and healthy for better rates</li>
          <li>Pre-existing conditions are typically excluded from coverage</li>
          <li>Higher deductibles and lower reimbursement rates reduce premiums</li>
          <li>Consider your budget vs. potential emergency vet costs (can be $5,000+)</li>
          <li>Read policy exclusions carefully - some breeds have specific restrictions</li>
