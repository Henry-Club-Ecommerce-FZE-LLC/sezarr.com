    question: "How much of my income should disability insurance replace?",
    answer: "Most experts recommend replacing 60-70% of your pre-tax income. This amount, combined with the fact that benefits are often tax-free, should cover most of your essential expenses during a disability."
  },
  {
    question: "What factors affect my disability insurance premiums?",
    answer: "Key factors include your age, gender, occupation, health status, benefit amount, waiting period, and benefit period. Younger, healthier individuals in low-risk occupations typically pay less."
  },
  {
    question: "Should I get short-term or long-term disability insurance?",
    answer: "Ideally, you should have both. Short-term covers immediate needs (first 3-12 months), while long-term provides protection for extended disabilities. Many people start with long-term and add short-term later."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I get disability insurance if I have health conditions?",
    answer: "It depends on the condition and severity. Some conditions may be excluded, result in higher premiums, or prevent coverage entirely. It's always best to apply while you're healthy."
  },
  {
    question: "How accurate is this disability insurance calculator?",
    answer: "This calculator provides reasonable estimates based on industry averages and standard formulas. However, actual premiums and coverage needs vary by insurer and individual circumstances. Always get professional quotes for accurate pricing."

              The recommended coverage is calculated based on 60-70% of your income, which is the standard

              Own-Occupation vs Any-Occupation
            </h3>
            <p class="text-blue-800 dark:text-blue-200">
              Own-occupation policies pay if you can't perform your specific job, even if you could work elsewhere. 
              Any-occupation policies only pay if you can't work in any suitable job. Own-occupation is more expensive but provides better protection.

              Benefit Period Options
            </h3>
            <p class="text-green-800 dark:text-green-200">
              You can choose benefit periods from 2 years to age 65-67. Longer benefit periods cost more but provide 
              protection against long-term disabilities. Most disabilities are short-term, but the financial impact of 
              long-term disabilities is much greater.

              Waiting Period (Elimination Period)
            </h3>
            <p class="text-yellow-800 dark:text-yellow-200">
              The waiting period is how long you must be disabled before benefits begin. Common options are 30, 60, 90, 
              180, or 365 days. Longer waiting periods significantly reduce premiums but require you to have enough 
              savings to bridge the gap.
