          <h2>Understanding Your Travel Insurance Quote</h2>
          
          <p>
            This calculator provides personalized estimates based on your specific travel plans and destination. 
            The recommendations are designed to help you understand the types of coverage most important for 
            your trip and approximate costs from leading travel insurance providers.
          </p>

          <h3>Key Coverage Components Evaluated</h3>
          
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Trip Cancellation/Interruption:</strong> Reimburses non-refundable trip costs if you must cancel or cut your trip short for covered reasons</li>
            <li><strong>Emergency Medical Coverage:</strong> Pays for medical treatment while traveling, crucial when your regular health insurance has limited coverage abroad</li>
            <li><strong>Emergency Evacuation:</strong> Covers transportation to nearest adequate medical facility or back home - can cost $50,000+ from remote locations</li>
            <li><strong>Baggage Protection:</strong> Compensates for lost, stolen, or delayed luggage and personal belongings</li>
            <li><strong>Travel Delay Coverage:</strong> Reimburses additional expenses (meals, lodging) due to covered travel delays</li>
            <li><strong>Accidental Death & Dismemberment:</strong> Provides benefits for covered accidents during travel</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Factors That Impact Your Premium</h3>

          <p>
            Several factors influence your travel insurance costs:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Destination Risk Level:</strong> Some regions have higher medical costs, political instability, or natural disaster risks</li>
            <li><strong>Trip Cost:</strong> Higher trip values require higher coverage limits for adequate protection</li>
            <li><strong>Traveler Age:</strong> Premiums increase significantly with age, especially after 50</li>
            <li><strong>Trip Length:</strong> Longer trips generally cost more to insure due to increased exposure</li>
            <li><strong>Activities Planned:</strong> Adventure sports and high-risk activities increase premiums</li>
            <li><strong>Pre-existing Conditions:</strong> Can be covered but may require specific timing and increase costs</li>
            <li><strong>Coverage Type:</strong> Comprehensive policies cost more but provide broader protection</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Destination-Specific Considerations</h3>

          <h4>International Travel</h4>
          <p>
            International destinations typically require higher medical coverage limits due to potentially expensive 
            healthcare systems and evacuation costs. Consider visa requirements (like Schengen area minimums) and 
            specific risks like natural disasters or political instability.
          </p>

          <h4>Domestic Travel</h4>
          <p>
            While medical evacuation costs may be lower within the US, trip cancellation protection remains valuable 
            for expensive domestic trips. Focus on coverage for non-refundable bookings and travel delays.
          </p>

          <h4>Adventure and High-Risk Travel</h4>
          <p>
            Activities like skiing, scuba diving, or mountain climbing require specialized coverage. Many standard 
            policies exclude these activities, so verify coverage or purchase add-ons.
          </p>

          <h3>When to Purchase Travel Insurance</h3>

          <p>
            Timing is crucial for maximum benefits:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Best Time:</strong> Within 10-21 days of making your initial trip deposit</li>
            <li><strong>Benefits of Early Purchase:</strong> Pre-existing condition coverage, Cancel for Any Reason eligibility, full trip cancellation protection</li>
            <li><strong>Last-Minute Options:</strong> Still valuable for medical coverage and emergency assistance, but with limited cancellation benefits</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Types of Travel Insurance Policies</h3>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Comprehensive:</strong> Full coverage including trip cancellation, medical, evacuation, and baggage protection</li>
            <li><strong>Medical-Only:</strong> Focus on health-related coverage for travelers with good trip protection elsewhere</li>
            <li><strong>Cancel for Any Reason (CFAR):</strong> Enhanced flexibility allowing cancellation for any reason (typically 75% reimbursement)</li>
            <li><strong>Annual/Multi-Trip:</strong> Cost-effective for frequent travelers taking multiple trips per year</li>
          </ul>

            <h4 class="text-yellow-800 dark:text-yellow-200 font-semibold mb-2">Important Reminders</h4>

              <li>• These are estimates - actual quotes may vary between insurance companies</li>
              <li>• Read policy exclusions carefully, especially for adventure activities and pre-existing conditions</li>
              <li>• Consider your existing coverage from health insurance, credit cards, and other sources</li>
              <li>• Purchase insurance as soon as you make your first trip payment for maximum benefits</li>
              <li>• Keep emergency contact numbers and policy information easily accessible while traveling</li>
