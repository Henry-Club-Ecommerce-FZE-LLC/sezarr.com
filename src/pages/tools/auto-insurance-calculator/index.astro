      <h2>Understanding Auto Insurance Coverage</h2>
      
      <h3>Liability Coverage</h3>
      <p>Liability insurance protects you when you're at fault in an accident. It covers:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Bodily Injury Per Person:</strong> Maximum paid for one person's injuries</li>
        <li><strong>Bodily Injury Per Accident:</strong> Maximum paid for all injuries in one accident</li>
        <li><strong>Property Damage:</strong> Maximum paid for damage to others' property</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Full Coverage Components</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Comprehensive:</strong> Covers theft, vandalism, weather damage, hitting an animal</li>
        <li><strong>Collision:</strong> Covers damage from crashes, regardless of fault</li>
        <li><strong>Uninsured/Underinsured Motorist:</strong> Protects you from drivers with inadequate coverage</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>How This Calculator Works</h3>
      <p>Our calculator uses industry best practices and considers:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your state's minimum requirements and typical claim costs</li>
        <li>Asset protection needs based on your net worth</li>
        <li>Vehicle value and loan requirements</li>
        <li>Optimal deductibles based on your financial situation</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="bg-blue-50 dark:bg-blue-900/20 p-6 rounded-lg">
        <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-3">ðŸ’¡ Pro Tips</h4>
        <ul class="space-y-2">
          <li>Consider umbrella insurance if you have significant assets</li>
          <li>Higher deductibles can significantly reduce premiums</li>
          <li>Review your coverage annually as your financial situation changes</li>
          <li>Don't just buy minimum coverage - it rarely provides adequate protection</li>
        </ul>
